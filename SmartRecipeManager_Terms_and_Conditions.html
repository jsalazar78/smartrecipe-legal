          <p><strong>Summary:</strong> These Terms govern your use of <em>SmartRecipeManager</em>. By creating an account or using the app, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="s1">1. Who we are</h2>
        <p>These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) apply to your use of the <strong>SmartRecipeManager</strong> mobile and/or web application and related services (collectively, the “Service”), operated by <strong>SmartRecipeManager</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”).</p>

        <h2 id="s2">2. Accounts</h2>
        <p><strong>Accounts allowed:</strong> Yes. Users may create accounts to access the Service.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity under your account. You must be <strong>13+</strong> to use the Service. If you open an account on behalf of a company or organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity, and “you” includes the entity.</p>

        <h2 id="s3">3. User Content</h2>
        <p><strong>User content allowed:</strong> Yes. You may create and/or upload content (such as text, images, or other materials) to the Service (“User Content”).</p>
        <p><strong>Ownership:</strong> You retain ownership of your User Content. By submitting User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to host, store, process, display, and transmit your User Content as needed to operate, improve, secure, and provide the Service. This license ends when your User Content is deleted from our systems, subject to reasonable backup and archival practices.</p>
        <p>You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to submit your User Content and that your User Content does not violate any law or these Terms.</p>

        <h2 id="s4">4. Our Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>All rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, including our logos, visual design, trade dress, trademarks, service marks, and proprietary content (collectively, “Our Content”) are and will remain our exclusive property or that of our licensors. You may not use Our Content without prior written permission, except as permitted by law.</p>

        <h2 id="s5">5. Feedback</h2>
        <p>If you provide suggestions, ideas, or feedback (“Feedback”), you agree that we may use, disclose, and otherwise exploit such Feedback without restriction and without compensation or credit to you.</p>

        <h2 id="s6">6. Purchases and Payments</h2>
        <p><strong>In-app purchases:</strong> No. <br>
           <strong>One-time purchases (goods/services):</strong> No. <br>
           <strong>Subscriptions:</strong> No.
        </p>
        <p>Since the Service does not currently offer paid purchases, subscriptions, or goods, no payment processing occurs within the app. If we introduce payments later, we will update these Terms and provide notice via in-app notices.</p>

        <h2 id="s7">7. Refunds &amp; Cancellations</h2>
        <p>Because there are no purchases in the Service at this time, there are no refunds or cancellations applicable. If paid features are introduced in the future, the applicable refund and cancellation terms (including any platform-specific rules, such as Apple App Store terms) will be provided at that time.</p>

        <h2 id="s8">8. Promotions</h2>
        <p>We do not currently offer promotions, contests, or sweepstakes. If we do in the future, additional terms will apply and will be presented with the promotion.</p>

        <h2 id="s9">9. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to, and not to allow others to:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Violate the rights of others, including privacy, publicity, and intellectual property rights;</li>

          <li>Misrepresent your identity or affiliation, or attempt to circumvent access or usage limits;</li>

          <li>Use the Service to train, test, or operate competing datasets or services without our consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="s10">10. Termination and Suspension</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without notice, if we reasonably believe: (a) you have violated these Terms, (b) doing so is necessary to comply with law or protect the Service or other users, or (c) the account has been inactive for an extended period. You may stop using the Service at any time. Upon termination, the rights granted to you under these Terms will end, except for provisions that by their nature should survive (e.g., intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, dispute resolution).</p>

        <h2 id="s11">11. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Service may link to or interoperate with third-party websites, apps, or services. We are not responsible for third-party content or practices. Your use of third-party services is governed by their terms and policies.</p>

We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.</p>

        <h2 id="s13">13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will we be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your use of or inability to use the Service; (b) any conduct or content of any user or third party; or (c) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content. Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the Service will not exceed one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100) or the amount you paid us in the past twelve months (if any), whichever is greater.</p>

        <h2 id="s14">14. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us and our officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Service, your User Content, or your violation of these Terms.</p>

        <h2 id="s15">15. Governing Law</h2>

        <h2 id="s16">16. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</h2>
        <p><strong>Informal resolution first.</strong> Before filing a claim, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by emailing us at <a href="mailto:smartrecipemanager@bohwiz.com">smartrecipemanager@bohwiz.com</a>. If we cannot resolve the dispute within 30 days, either party may commence formal proceedings.</p>
        <p><strong>Binding arbitration.</strong> Except for claims that may be brought in small claims court, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be resolved by binding individual arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will take place in Cook County, Illinois, in English. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.</p>
        <p><strong>Class action waiver.</strong> You and we agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or our individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</p>
        <p><strong>30-day opt-out.</strong> You may opt out of arbitration by sending written notice to <a href="mailto:smartrecipemanager@bohwiz.com">smartrecipemanager@bohwiz.com</a> within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.</p>

        <h2 id="s17">17. Changes to the Service and to these Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update the Service and these Terms from time to time. When we make material changes, we will provide notice via in-app notices.

          <li><strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force.</li>
          <li><strong>No waiver.</strong> Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later.</li>
          <li><strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law.</li>
