        <h1>CookMateAI · Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> November 08, 2025</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) apply to your use of the
            <strong>CookMateAI</strong> mobile and/or web application and related
            services (collectively, the “Service”), operated by
            <strong>CookMateAI</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”).
        </p>

        <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
        <p><strong>Accounts allowed:</strong> Yes. Users may create accounts to access the Service.</p>
        <p>
            You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login
            credentials and for all activity under your account. You must be
            <strong>13+</strong> to use the Service.
            If you open an account on behalf of a company or organization,
            you represent that you have authority to bind that entity, and “you”
            includes the entity.
        </p>

        <h2>3. User Content</h2>
        <p><strong>User content allowed:</strong> Yes. You may create and/or upload content
            (such as text, images, or other materials) to the Service (“User Content”).</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Ownership:</strong> You retain ownership of your User Content.
            By submitting User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive,
            royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to host, store,
            process, display, and transmit your User Content as needed to operate,
            improve, secure, and provide the Service. This license ends when your
            User Content is deleted from our systems, subject to reasonable backup
            and archival practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to submit
            your User Content and that your User Content does not violate any law
            or these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Our Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
            All rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, including our
            logos, visual design, trade dress, trademarks, service marks, and
            proprietary content (collectively, “Our Content”) are and will remain
            our exclusive property or that of our licensors. You may not use Our
            Content without prior written permission, except as permitted by law.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Feedback</h2>
        <p>
            If you provide suggestions, ideas, or feedback (“Feedback”), you agree
            that we may use, disclose, and otherwise exploit such Feedback without
            restriction and without compensation or credit to you.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Purchases and Payments</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>In-app purchases:</strong> No. <br />
            <strong>One-time purchases (goods/services):</strong> No. <br />
            <strong>Subscriptions:</strong> No.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the Service does not currently offer paid purchases, subscriptions,
            or goods, no payment processing occurs within the app. If we introduce
            payments later, we will update these Terms and provide notice via in-app
            notices.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Refunds &amp; Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
            Because there are no purchases in the Service at this time, there are
            no refunds or cancellations applicable. If paid features are introduced
            in the future, the applicable refund and cancellation terms (including
            any platform-specific rules, such as Apple App Store terms) will be
            provided at that time.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Promotions</h2>
        <p>
            We do not currently offer promotions, contests, or sweepstakes. If we do
            in the future, additional terms will apply and will be presented with
            the promotion.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to, and not to allow others to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable law or regulation;</li>
            <li>Upload, post, or transmit content that is illegal, infringing, defamatory, obscene, hateful, harassing, or otherwise objectionable;</li>
            <li>Violate the rights of others, including privacy, publicity, and intellectual property rights;</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the Service except to the extent permitted by law;</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity, performance, or security of the Service, including by introducing malware or scraping the Service;</li>
            <li>Access the Service using automated means (such as bots or crawlers) without our prior written permission;</li>
            <li>Misrepresent your identity or affiliation, or attempt to circumvent access or usage limits;</li>
            <li>Collect or harvest personally identifiable information from the Service except as expressly permitted;</li>
            <li>Use the Service to train, test, or operate competing datasets or services without our consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Termination and Suspension</h2>
        <p>
            We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with
            or without notice, if we reasonably believe: (a) you have violated these
            Terms, (b) doing so is necessary to comply with law or protect the
            Service or other users, or (c) the account has been inactive for an
            extended period. You may stop using the Service at any time. Upon
            termination, the rights granted to you under these Terms will end, except
            for provisions that by their nature should survive (e.g., intellectual
            property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, dispute resolution).
        </p>

        <h2>11. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The Service may link to or interoperate with third-party websites, apps,
            or services. We are not responsible for third-party content or practices.
            Your use of third-party services is governed by their terms and policies.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
            The Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. To the
            fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or
            implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
            particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that
            the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will we be liable for
            any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or
            any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly,
            or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting
            from (a) your use of or inability to use the Service; (b) any conduct or
            content of any user or third party; or (c) unauthorized access, use, or
            alteration of your transmissions or content. Our total liability for any
            claim arising out of or relating to the Service will not exceed one
            hundred U.S. dollars (US$100) or the amount you paid us in the past
            twelve months (if any), whichever is greater.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
            You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us and our officers, directors,
            employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages,
            losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out
            of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Service,
            your User Content, or your violation of these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Illinois, USA</strong>,
            without regard to its conflict of law principles.
        </p>

        <h2>16. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Informal resolution first.</strong> Before filing a claim, you
            agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by emailing us at
            <a href="mailto:cookmateai@bohwiz.com">cookmateai@bohwiz.com</a>.
            If we cannot resolve the dispute within 30 days, either party may
            commence formal proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Binding arbitration.</strong> Except for claims that may be
            brought in small claims court, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising
            out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be resolved by
            binding individual arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
            Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The
            arbitration will take place in Cook County, Illinois, in English. The
            Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of
            this arbitration provision.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Class action waiver.</strong> You and we agree that each may
            bring claims against the other only in your or our individual capacity
            and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or
            representative proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>30-day opt-out.</strong> You may opt out of arbitration by
            sending written notice to
            <a href="mailto:cookmateai@bohwiz.com">cookmateai@bohwiz.com</a>
            within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>17. Changes to the Service and to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
            We may update the Service and these Terms from time to time. When we
            make material changes, we will provide notice via in-app notices. The
            updated Terms are effective when posted or when the notice is provided,
            as applicable. Your continued use of the Service after the effective
            date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>18. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>
            If you have any questions about these Terms &amp; Conditions, you can

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service.</li>
